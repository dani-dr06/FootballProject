## Introduction

Being a huge football fan and since there has been much talk recently about Chelsea's 2023 winter transfer window spending, I thought it could be useful for fans, journalists, and others who want to learn more about the sport to have an understanding of transfer market spending trends across the top five European football leagues (Bundesliga, LaLiga, Ligue 1, Premier League, and Serie A). Therefore, I collected transfer window spending data (transfer fees paid by clubs) available on the website Transfermarkt for all the leagues from the 2000/01 season to the 2021/22 season. Then, I created some Tableau visualizations to gain some insights.

## Findings:
One can obtain different insights from the visualizations:

- **Which are the top 5 leagues and where are they located?**

For people who are new to football and do not know the top five leagues, there is a map showing league name and locations, as well as the total amount spent over the past 22 years for each respective league?

- **How much has each league spent? Which league is the highest/lowest spender?**
The Premier League was the highest spender by far, spending a total of €21,837 million in transfer fees, followed by the Serie A at €14,104 million, LaLiga at €10,808 million, and finally the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 spent roughly the same at €7,191 and €7,117 million respectively.

- **What transfer spending trends can we see?*
- We can see that transfer spending has been in a steady upward trend over the years, with the season with the lowest total spending being the 2003/2004 season, and it is very interesting to see a clear drop in spending starting after the 2019/20 season (impact of the covid pandemic).
