## Introduction

Being a huge football fan and since there has been much talk recently about Chelsea's 2023 winter transfer window spending, I thought it could be useful for fans, journalists, and others who want to learn more about the sport to have an understanding of transfer market spending trends across the top five European football leagues (Bundesliga, LaLiga, Ligue 1, Premier League, and Serie A). Therefore, I collected transfer window spending data (transfer fees paid by clubs) available on the website Transfermarkt for all the leagues from the 2000/01 season to the 2021/22 season.
